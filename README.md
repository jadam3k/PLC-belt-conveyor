# Conveyor Project

I created this project as part of my learning journey in **industrial automation**.  
I think I managed to deliver what I aimed for, and I’m really happy with how it turned out.  
Honestly, I’m proud of myself.

## About the Project

The main goal was to **design and build a small conveyor system**, focusing on both the **mechanical** and **electrical** sides of automation.  
This project helped me understand a lot about **PLC programming**, **relay control**, and how to organize everything neatly and efficiently.

## Documentation

Below, I’m including the **relay schematic** and an explanation of how the system works.  
I decided **not to make a full general wiring diagram** yet, because the system is quite complex —  
but if needed, I can create it later.  

For now, I have:
- A **relay circuit diagram**
- A **PLC control schematic**
- The **3D model** of the conveyor (without the belt)

## Acknowledgements

I want to thank my **teachers** for teaching me the knowledge and skills necessary to make this project possible.  
Their support and lessons were key to completing this work.
