# Conveyor Project

I created this project as part of my learning journey in **industrial automation**.  
I’m really happy with how it turned out — and honestly, pretty proud of myself.

## About the Project

The main goal was to **design and build a small conveyor system**, covering both the **mechanical** and **electrical** sides of automation.  
This project taught me a lot about **PLC programming**, **relay logic**, and how to put everything together in a clean and efficient way.

## Documentation

Below are some materials showing how the system works.  
I didn’t make a full wiring diagram because the project is quite detailed,  
but I can always create one later if needed.

For now, I’ve included:
