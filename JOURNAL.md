## 11/1/2025 - Looking for cheap components  

**That's the part I don't like****.** Surprisingly, I managed to find a controller with extensions on eBay for $130, which is a good deal. Finding the rest of the devices and checking if they would work wasn't so easy. Finally, I managed to find the right setup

## 11/3/2025 8 PM - Making Drives  

## The hardest part

> Honestly, that was the worst part.  
> I really wanted to do it right — respecting both the material and the money.

## Considering the options

I even thought about buying a set of these shafts on AliExpress, but it was just too expensive.

---

## Figuring out the power

The real challenge was figuring out how the shaft should be powered.  
All the online listings showed shafts with bearings that weren’t suitable for this setup.

---

## Time and effort

It took me over two days, spending about four hours every day, just to understand what was going on, **even my dad helped me**

> BTW, let me know how you like my new post format. I decided to use the features and play around with them.

## Contact diagram

Honestly, this was the easiest part — and I really enjoyed it.  
It took me about half an hour, as I wanted to make sure to avoid any short circuits.  

In the next step, I’ll move on to programming the **PLC controller** using **LAD (Ladder Logic)**.
