## 11/1/2025 - Looking for cheap components  

**That's the part I don't like****.** Surprisingly, I managed to find a controller with extensions on eBay for $130, which is a good deal. Finding the rest of the devices and checking if they would work wasn't so easy. Finally, I managed to find the right setup

## 11/3/2025 8 PM - Making Drives  

## The hardest part

> Honestly, that was the worst part.  
> I really wanted to do it right — respecting both the material and the money.

---

## Considering the options

I even thought about buying a set of these shafts on AliExpress, but it was just too expensive.

---

## Figuring out the power

The real challenge was figuring out how the shaft should be powered.  
All the online listings showed shafts with bearings that weren’t suitable for this setup.

---

## Time and effort

It took me over two days, spending about four hours every day, just to understand what was going on, **even my dad helped me**

> BTW, let me know how you like my new post format. I decided to use the features and play around with them.
  

## 11/3/2025 10 PM - Contact diagram  

## Contact diagram

Honestly, this was the easiest part — and I really enjoyed it.  
It took me about half an hour, as I wanted to make sure to avoid any short circuits.  

In the next step, I’ll move on to programming the **PLC controller** using **LAD (Ladder Logic)**.

## 11/4/2025 7 PM - Programming PLC in LAD  


## A Productive Day with PLC Programming

> Today I spent some time working on a PLC controller in CODESYS using the LAD (Ladder Diagram) language.  
> It was actually pretty fun.

I’m learning automation right now — I’m studying to become an automation technician — so this kind of stuff is part of what I do.  
It turned out to be quite easy for a 16-year-old. The whole thing, including debugging, took me about an hour.

**Now I'm moving on to creating an interesting structure.**

## 11/4/2025 11 PM - designing support for pulleys  


## Working on the Linear Pulleys

> I’m now working on the linear pulleys and their brackets.  
> The brackets will be mounted on my 2020 aluminum profiles, which will serve as the frame.

It didn’t take long — after about an hour, everything was set up pretty smoothly.  
Quick and easy, just the way I like it.

## 11/5/2025 7 PM - Making 3D view of the Conveyor  

Today I worked on the overall look of the entire conveyor — basically the **3D model of the whole machine (without the belt)** (no AI usage) 🔥.  
It turned out really well — I’m proud of myself, and I can feel that the project is almost finished.

What’s left is optionally adding a **3D model of my electrical cabinet**, which will include the **PLC, relays, power supply**, and all the **necessary components and fuses**.  

I’d say the work went great — it took me about **10 hours**, and I’m genuinely happy with the progress I’m making.  
Still, I can’t help but worry a bit that my project might not get accepted.  
Not sure why I feel that way... ;/

## 11/5/2025 8 PM - Final Touches and Hoping for Approval  

## Final Touches and Hoping for Approval

> Last tweaks, adding the **BOM**, and praying for the project to be accepted.  
> I’ve been working on the final adjustments, prepared the **Bill of Materials**, and below I’m adding a small **FAQ** explaining a few things.

Overall, I consider this project **very good**.  
It might look simple at first glance, but it actually took me a lot of time — I didn’t want to rely on expensive, ready-made solutions.  

This project will really help me at school, because as I mentioned before in earlier posts, I’m still a student who’s really interested in **industrial automation**.  
A project like this is a perfect example of that passion.

### FAQ

**Why did you spend so much money, and why use such an expensive PLC controller?**  
I really want to learn about **PLC controllers** and **automation**, and this project felt like the perfect opportunity to do that.  
I’m very grateful to the whole **Blueprint project** for giving me this chance and for letting people see my work.  
I tried to keep the costs as low as possible — I even bought **used parts**, like a second-hand PLC from eBay.  
Still, I wanted **stability and reliability**, and the **Siemens LOGO!** controller will definitely help me enter the world of **industrial automation**, which I’m eager to keep learning about.

---

**Why did you spend so little time on it?**  
Actually, I was thinking about the project all the time — even while at school.  
In total, I estimate around **50–60 hours of work**.  
My teachers were probably getting tired of me sketching circuits, mechanisms, and doing all the calculations needed to make sure everything would work properly.

## 11/9/2025 - Changes to the project  

Since my project wasn't eligible for funding, I decided to pay for it myself. I changed some parts and 3D prints to make things easier, and I'll also buy a different PLC.
